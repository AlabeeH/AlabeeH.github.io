    <p>
    I was born on October 5th, i like to play sports my favorite is soccer.
    My favorite subject is math.
    When i graduate I would like to become a real estate agent. 
    </p>
    I like to play soccer because it's funa and I get to spend time with my friends.
    I would like to become a real estate agent because they make good money and looks fun to do.
    I would like to have as many free time and I think real estate can provide that when i become successful.
